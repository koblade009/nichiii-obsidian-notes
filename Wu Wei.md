Wu wei is a fundamental concept in ancient Chinese Taoist philosophy, literally meaning "non-doing" or "effortless action". It describes a state of being where one's actions are in perfect harmony with the natural flow of the universe, requiring no forceful effort and leading to greater effectiveness. Rather than a call to inaction or laziness, it's about acting spontaneously and with maximum skill and efficiency, much like being "in the zone"

Basically, don't force it. The harder you try, the more you fail.

If it's stupid but it works, it's not stupid.
