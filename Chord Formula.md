Chords are mostly triads
which means 3 notes
Root note, 3rd, 5th 

Major chords formula
1 . . . 2 . . 3
Minor chords formula
1 . . 2 . . . 3

C major chord
C Root > [C#, D, D#] > E > [F, F#] G

C minor chord
C Root > [C#, D,] > D# > [E, F, F#] G



This is prolly advanced already but
Chords don't have to follow the exact same order
ex. C major chord : C E G
G E C is still C major chord

I think this is particularly useful for guitar playing as well
