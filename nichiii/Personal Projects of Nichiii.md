Long-term creative projects of [[nichiii]]

[[🌍 Canicee]] - This is essentially a combined world of all my creations. Witchlands, Golden Troupe and even characters that exist in the "real world". Essentially, IPs that I own.

Other projects I want to pursue:
- Cebuano representation - I would like to create animations that feature Bisrock music
- PH Hiphop representation - I would like to create art that feature PH Hiphop music
