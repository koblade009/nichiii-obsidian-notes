This one has something I feel I needed to hear:
- "I like copying businesses that already work and then iterate/differentiate myself later"
- Originality is mostly just ego/pride, therefore it should not be allowed to get in the way of starting a business
- Marketing and business models -> Just copy what successful businesses do. Chances are, if their marketing strategies work for them, it'll prolly also work for you
