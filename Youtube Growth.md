How the algo works:
- It's sorta all about algo confidence, if your channel is clear in what it is then the algo knows who to recommend it to.

Notes:
- I think the way to go would be to release similar content as much as possible for as long as possible. 
- What happened on my YT so far:
	- Noelle Genshin coomer meme <- blew up and what got me to 100 subs
	- Then I did art streams for a bit which got me around 20 subs
	- Then I started doing covers
		- Bisrock <- 0 subs <- relatively plenty of views, I think it got recommended to non-bisayan audience, the problem is that listeners of bisrock are prolly lower than 100 and tbh they'd rather listen to the original.
			- I still wanna make covers of bisrock songs though, even though there's no audience for it. So essentially, the best time to them would be now that I still don't have a lot of subs/views. It's basically now or never cuz if I reach a bigger audience, I can no longer make hyper niche stuff.
		- 
		- Radiohead - Let Down <- 3 subs <- the shorts specifically got a lot of views and some comments too. Even though, it was one of the not so good covers I made.
			- I think there's a lot of people who listen to radiohead and are interested in watching covers
