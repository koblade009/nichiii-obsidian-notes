How the algo works:
- It's sorta all about algo confidence, if your channel is clear in what it is then the algo knows who to recommend it to.

Notes:
- I think the way to go would be to release similar content as much as possible for as long as possible. 
- What happened on my YT so far:
	- Noelle Genshin coomer meme <- blew up and what got me to 100 subs 
		- This is no longer relevant tho, I think I need to think of my channel as having zero subs
	- Then I did art streams for a bit which got me around 20 subs
	- Then I started doing covers
		- Bisrock <- 0 subs <- relatively plenty of views, I think it got recommended to non-bisayan audience, the problem is that listeners of bisrock are prolly lower than 100 and tbh they'd rather listen to the original.
			- I still wanna make covers of bisrock songs though, even though there's no audience for it. So essentially, the best time to them would be now that I still don't have a lot of subs/views. It's basically now or never cuz if I reach a bigger audience, I can no longer make hyper niche stuff.

		- Tagalog/Rock OPM <- 0 subs <- Kay Tagal Kitang Hinintay had the highest no. of views from all my covers it was like 260. It had my worst singing tho, which is unfortunate. I definitely think there's an audience for it.
			- To dissect it more:
				- I think stuff that is popular with female listeners are really good
					- Cup of Joe
					- December Avenue
				- I also think that classic/highschool nostalgia stuff are really good
					- Parokya ni Edgar
					- Kamikazee
					- Sponge Cola
				- I think it's a bit more niche, but PH emo music prolly has really chill tech savvy audience too:
					- Chicosci
					- Typecast

		- Rap Covers <- 1 sub <- 2 twitter followers <- I initially thought these would be more popular than opm rock music, but in actuality, it's more niche. I don't think filipino weebs listen to rap music as much, they prolly listen to rock opm tho. I do feel like the audience ph rap music are so fucking cool and chill.
			- I think I need to dissect it more tho.
				- HGHMNDS-adjacent: Omar Baliw, 1096 Gang, RHYNE <- This is prolly best rap audience to have, super chill, super motivated people
				- Flip D production / Exbatallion / Flow G / Skusta <- Prolly second best audience, more tech savvy, some presence on twitter/ overlap with kpop stans
				- Decent audience > Popular/classic rap < Gloc 9 , 187 mobstaz/fliptop-adjacent, very high overlap with general OPM listeners, just look up wish bus on which are super popular
				- Not compatible > ph gangster rap <- Basically rappers who care a lot about street cred stuff, BnK, Pricetagg, O Side Mafia
		
		- English music <- Radiohead - Let Down <- 3 subs <- the shorts specifically got a lot of views and some comments too. Even though, it was one of the not so good covers I made.
			- I think there's a lot of people who listen to radiohead and are interested in watching covers
			- I think english music just has the most number of audience in general.
			- To dissect it
				- 2000s alt rock music
					- Yellow Card
					- Fall Out Boy
					- Boys Like Girl
				- Emo era music
					- 
					- All Time Low
					- 

- The plan:
	- Bisrock Covers 
	- OPM Rock Music and Rap Covers
	- English Songs <- Radiohead, Linkin Park, etc
- Will never do:
	- English Rap Covers <- Reasoning for this is audience incompatability. I think anime culture is not welcome to these audience 
- Prolly won't do:
	- Japanese/Vocaloid/Vtuber Music <- As much as I love a lot of it, I just don't speak the language, nor am I able to play the instrumentals since the style is super different
