- Super important and applies especially to me:
	- **Make sure tracks don't clash with each other** Mixing already starts at the arrangement stage. Like if I strum my guitar haphazardly, it will obviously muddy everything up. It's cuz if you really take a close look at your favorite songs, you'll see that the instrumentations and vocals have their own pockets, it's like a puzzle. Each have their own space. And if I haphazardly make sounds where another track could use that space to enhance itself, it will make things worse. If you do this correctly and let the song breathe, the music will mix itself.
	- **Phasing/layering (especially for low end freq)** Sound is waves. If the waves are opposites, they will cancel each other, and no
