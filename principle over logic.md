Think something like:
- I make content. Not because I have to. But because that's who I am. That's what I do.
- This is related to [[Plans for 2026]] resolution on developing identity.
	- Regarding principle over logic, this is also related to strengthening my identity.
	- Don't do things because it's logical. Do things because it's part of your principles/values. [[Core Values of Nichiii]]
	- Or to put it on another way, don't do things when it's against your values, even when it's super tempting to do it. 
	- Some amendments to core values I would like to add:
		-  Never beg for help. Never beg for support. Make money not because people pity you. Rather I want to make money because people want to buy my product.
			- Reinforces my decision to never open a patreon/fanbox account.
