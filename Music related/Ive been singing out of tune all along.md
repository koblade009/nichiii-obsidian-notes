I downloaded a tuner app and turns out, what I think is a C note was a G note. Like when I try to sing C in my head, what actually comes out of my mouth is a G note.
So I guess I was singing 5 semitones lower than I should been singing. This kinda also explains why chitose sounded better when I pitched her voice up 2 semitones before...

Honestly quite insightful tbh. 

Anyways, I wanna get good at playing two instruments:
- Guitar - I don't have much issues with this rn, aside from rhythm, and left hand stamina
- Vocals [[My voice is also an instrument]] - My biggest problem right now is that:
	- This instrument is not calibrated. Like It's not like a fretted guitar where when you press a string on a certain fret, it plays the exact note that you want. With my voice, I can't really hear the note I sing. Not to mention, my sense for notes is really bad. Like I can't even say what is a c note. I can't imagine it. I'm not calibrated.

Things about music I need to get better at:
- Rhythm -  Need metronome practice
- Hand stamina - 
	- Fingertip callus
	- Thumb muscle fatigue
	- Finger dexterity
