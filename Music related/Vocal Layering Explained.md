Double track:
- Both vocal tracks dead center
Triple track:
- One dead center, two at the very sides (100% pan) at lower volumes
Harmonies:
- Use with purpose 
- 5 types > [[Harmonies Explained]]

Vocal pads:
 - Kinda like harmonies but just oooohs and aaaahs etc
 Gang vocals:
 - Chanting feel. Kinda try thinking of it as if each voice is a different character/person
 Stripped down / No layering:
 - Still extremely powerful, and prolly will be what I need to do most of the time. Since it gives a feel of vulnerability/sincerity
