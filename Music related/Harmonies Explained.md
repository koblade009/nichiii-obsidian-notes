1. Parallel Harmony
	1. Same melody, same phrasing, just shift it up or down to the 3rd or 5ths 
		1. 3rd above btw means theres 3 semi tones in between so essentially, it's 2 tones above
		2. >C< : C# D D# : >E< In this case the main is C and the harmony is E
2. Counterpoint harmony:
	1. Different melody, different style/direction,
3. Pedal point harmony:
	1. Lower tone and you stay in one note singing it. While the main track dances on top of it
4. Open harmony:
	1. Far intervals, harmony is very high compared to the main track,
	2. Maybe an octave above the main track then perhaps try changing up the melody as it goes
5. Close harmony:
	1. Super close intervals and prolly multiple of them, 2nd, 3rd, 5th. 
	2. Sounds like the voices are melting together
	3. It's like chords per note I guess
