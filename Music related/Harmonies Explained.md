1. Parallel Harmony
	1. Same melody, same phrasing, just shift it up or down to the 3rd or 5ths 
		1. 3rd above btw means theres 3 semi tones in between so essentially, it's 2 tones above
		2. >C< : C# D D# : >E< In this case the main is C and the harmony is E
2. Counterpoint harmony:
	1. Different melody, different style/direction,
3. Pedal point harmony:
	1. Lower tone and you stay in one note singing it. While the main track dances on top of it
