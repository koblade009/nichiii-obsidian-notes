### Other notes:
- I think it's also important to clearly lay down exactly how I want my covers to feel like.
- I think it's important that my cover doesn't try to compete with the feel of the original music. Essentially people don't have any reason to listen to my cover if my cover feels too similar to the OG. Why listen to an inferior version of the same thing after all.
- I think I want my covers to be like MTV Unplugged. 
	- Vocals and Guitars
	- With Bass and Cajon Beatbox at most
	- If it's a rock track, it should be strummed like it's an electric guitar still.
	- I don't want to make "quiet" versions of non-acoustic music
