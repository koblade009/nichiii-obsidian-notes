Considering:
-  [[Clothing Prints]]
-  Merchandising for [[Personal Projects of Nichiii]]
-  [[Season of Obsession]] Fan Merch/Not just clothing prints (Needs to be studied best way to approach this)
- [[Chitose Music Project]] - Music project < - This is not going to be significant. Moreso, I see this as a way to advertise merch since I plan to only draw for the sake of fun in the future.

Key points to consider before pursuing income sources:
- Scalability
- Ease
- Can be replicated reliably

Low chance:
- Manufacturing of vtuber/content creator assets < - Will only be scalable if the assets are meant for generic use
- Digital Products - doujinshis, sticker packs, wallpaper <- These require me to put a shitton of hours to make these, so it's likely not feasible atm
- Game Development <- I'm particularly interested with this because it involves a lot of creativity
- YouTube <- Mayhaps? Dunno tho. It is very scalable though.

Absolute no-go:
 - Streaming <- I am not good at this
