[[21glucose income sources]]

### What is 21glucose?
21glucose is a new thing I wanna start. It's a company pretty much.

### How does 21glucose make money?
ATM it generates no money at all.
The things I'm considering can


21glucose currently operates via fourthwall



I want to build 21glucose into a business that can operate without my supervision. Or at least with less work on my part. I want it to be able to generate money for me even in times that I am unable to work.


So... what I want to do is to give 21glucose sources of income

What I'm thinking of right now is
21glucose sources of income:
Fourthwall - > Print on Demand Merchandise (Scalable)
Fourthwall (?) - > Digital Products

Of course, 21glucose would probably never ever get any eyes on it without work on my part. Hence, I will prolly need to somewhat merge my online identity with it for some time so that any art the I make (nichiii) will come under the 21glucose name.

Therefore, I need to make changes on how I operate.
1. When I make fanart, it has to reflect the products 21glucose makes. If I sell fashion products then the fanart I make should focus on fashion even if the fanart itself doesn't feature any of my products.
2. I need to promote the name "21glucose" as much as possible. Which means I should make art of my ocs with giant 21glucose texts on them. Kinda like graffiti style I guess.
3. I guess my name (Nichiii) should prolly only appear in my twitter and pixiv as the names. My banner, everything else, branding-wise should be 21glucose focused.
