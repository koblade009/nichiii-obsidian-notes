Essentially 21glucose is a new thing I wanna start. It's a company pretty much.
And I, nichiii/kobenichiiii is just a part of it.

nichiii - artist / person
21glucose - brand/company

21glucose currently operates via fourthwall

nichiii (me) currently has these sources of income
Artistree -> SFW Commissions
Unifans - > NSFW Commissions

I want to build 21glucose into a business that can operate without my supervision. Or at least with less work on my part. I want it to be able to generate money for me even in times that I am unable to work.


So... what I want to do is to give 21glucose sources of income

What I'm thinking of right now is
21glucose sources of income:
Fourthwall - > Print on Demand Merchandise (Scalable)
Fourthwall (?) - > Digital Products

Of course, 21glucose would probably never ever get any eyes on it without work on my part. Hence, I will prolly need to somewhat merge my online identity with it for some time so that any art the I make (nichiii) will come under the 21glucose name.

Therefore, I need to make changes on how I operate.
1. When I make fanart, it has to reflect the products 21glucose makes. If I sell fashion products then the fanart
