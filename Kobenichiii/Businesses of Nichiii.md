Currently pursuing these as a source of income:

- [[21glucose]]
- [[NSFW Commissions]]
- [[SFW Commissions]]

Future move: 
- Commissions should become a lot more streamlined. Good example of this is my SFW Monochrome Portrait on Artistree. Less variables, less stress.
- Need to change nsfw and sfw commissions into skeb-type commissions
- Completely custom commissions should be priced differently. Custom commission should just automatically assume commercial use. Therefore commercial rates.


Absolute no-go:
- Fanbox <- Reason is that, there is inherent expectation to update it regularly and even more so, to commit to just one type of content that supporters have subscribed for. It violates one of my core values [[Core Values of Nichiii]] #1

### Vision:
I think the vision is to pretty much completely eliminate the need to do commissions. If I don't need commission money, I would prolly be able to become a lot more experimental with the type of art I make. This is because the stuff I post is essentially advertisement for the commission services. Also, commissions just take soooo much mental effort and takes so much social energy to do. Literally the only commissions where I actually didn't burn out in the process was when I was doing work for a japanese client who essentially treated my service as a skeb.
