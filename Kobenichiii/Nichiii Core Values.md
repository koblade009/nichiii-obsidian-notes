Values that I hold dear:
- Variety is the spice of life / Never stuck in a box
	- I'm aware it's going to be hard. Modern internet forces artists/cc's to stick to one thing that works in order to succeed. But I don't want that. My brain just doesn't thrive on that. When I do something repeatedly for long, I become depressed.
- Push only love. Kalmado mentality (Omar Baliw / 1096 Gang / G WOLF)
	- Office politics will only make the workplace feel like hell. 

Values that I clearly need to work on:
- Treasuring connection/Initiating friendly relationship to someone
	- I have this terrible mindset of just waiting for people to make the first move on me. It's something that stems from fear.
	- I also have this terrible fear of reaching out to someone to check how they're feeling. I struggle with this because there were times in the past when someone got insulted when I attempted this. 
- Open book / Wearing your heart in your sleeve / Vulnerability is not weakness
	- Whenever I'm down, mentally, I just shut myself off from the world. I still need to change this.

These values influence how I conduct business [[Businesses of Nichiii]]
