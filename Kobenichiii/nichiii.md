Nichiii is a hobby artist residing in Cebu Philippines

Pronouns: He/Him

Cultures I'm interested in:
- Music:
	- Filipino HipHop Music
	- Vocaloid (I love PinocchioP's stuff especially)
	- Bisrock (Visayan Rock Music)
- Weeb Culture:
	- Gacha: (Nikke is by far my favorite atm. BD2 is next. And then WuWa.)
	- VTubers: (My faves ATM are Kaheru, Bancho, AmeNina, and Ina)
	- Anime/Manga: (I fucking love horror manga. But there's also so many more. I actually made a list for it. But it's in comic form and I kinda forgot about it.)
	- Gaming: (I love FlyFF, FromSoftware games and DMC series. Also Nier Automata)
- Others:
	- Car Culture
	- Game Dev

Values that I hold dear:
- Variety is the spice of life / Never stuck in a box
	- I'm aware it's going to be hard. Modern internet forces artists/cc's to stick to one thing that works in order to succeed. But I don't want that. My brain just doesn't thrive on that. When I do something repeatedly for long, I become depressed.
- Push only love to your peers. Kalmado mentality (Omar Baliw / 1096 Gang).
	- My irl work experience has taught me a lesson. Office politics will only make the workplace feel like hell. I want to make it so that no one, not even people I consider friends, will ever hear me say something bad about fellow content creators whatever their reputation may be. And if a fellow content creator has beef with me, if they don't send me a direct message I will not engage with them.
