Denoising audio
![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6UcUYPUZuQ)

Use the plugin ReaFir:
- Mode: Subtract 
- Tick "Automatically build noise profile"
- Then playback that part that only has noise
- After that untick it



### For amplifying waveform sections
- Split
- F2 for item properties
- Adjust volume

### Other stuff
I think my process needs an overhaul

- Actions > create new measure
- Check the approx bpm . ex 84.9 = 85bpm
