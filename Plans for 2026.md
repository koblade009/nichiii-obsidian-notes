- chitose2e - music 
- chitose3e - yt content, I'm not sure if I should put it on the same channel as the music/art channel, prolly should since I can just make a playlist for music stuff
	- low effort, chill/vacation style, quantity focused content
	- game stream/gameplay vid:
		- dota 2
	- can also do some general video content I guess. maybe like a podcast-style thing. just talk about about what's going on in 
- nsfw art stuff <- I'm having trouble with this. I wanna stream but at the same time, I don't feel very good streaming on pomf. I don't necessarily really want to just draw loli content. 
- sfw art stuff <- 
	- dota 2 fanart
	- chitose stuff
