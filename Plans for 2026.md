## Plans:
- chitose2e - moar music covers throughout the year
- chitose3e - yt content, I'm not sure if I should put it on the same channel as the music/art channel, prolly should since I can just make a playlist for music stuff
	- low effort, chill/vacation style, quantity focused content
	- game stream/gameplay vid:
		- dota 2
	- can also do some general video content I guess. maybe like a podcast-style thing. just talk about about what's going on in the dota scene etc. even like reaction content. ex. ti9 OG reaction. or recent matches. "chitose reacts to dreamleague Parivision vs Team Spirit" etc.
- nsfw art stuff <- I'm having trouble with this. I wanna stream but at the same time, I don't feel very good streaming on pomf. I don't necessarily really want to just draw loli content. I wanna draw other stuff too, but I just can't really find the right platform atm. 
- sfw art stuff 
	- dota 2 fanart
	- chitose stuff
	- fan art for dota 2 vtubers


## Overall resolution: 
- stay in my lane, do things that I love, stay true to who I am
- [[Oath of never doubting myself again]]
- develop my identity as a content creator
	- put myself out there
	- give away who i am both the good and the bad
- find my ikigai ![[IKIGAI]]
