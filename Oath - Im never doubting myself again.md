It's so weird, self-doubt really makes you irrational
I think I've been on the right path looking back. In retrospect, I can't really recall regretting any decisions that I've made so far. More like the self-hate I've been constantly experience is about the future.

I don't regret spending so much time learning art. I don't regret making the content I made. I don't regret redirecting my time towards making other content.
What got me really depressed was worrying that I won't get anywhere or won't have a future because it felt like I wasn't improving and I guess it was also because of twitter numbers.

Twitter numbers -
I have zero regrets that I've lost all the audience I had back when I was doing NSFW stuff more consistently. 
I had doubts and was miserable with the fact that my numbers now are low and the likelihood that my works will be seen by people is abysmally low.

However, when I look back and really dissect it, I don't think I've made any wrong decisions since I started doing art back in 2021

- 2021 - 
	- Made in Abyss, General Anime Fanart + Kpop fanart

- 2022
	- My very first consistent client -> nsfw boxing art
	- Somewhat livable income from commissions. It was so painful but in the end I think it was all worth it. I improved so much and developed my drawing process.
	- Income: commissions -> I think this was the most that I earned and could have even been so much more had I not been in a relationship with someone.

	- Started getting into FlyFF and made art of FlyFF Characters -> gave me chitose
	- Started using unifans and finally got a bit of a start from it thanks to kai for commissioning an artwork.
	- Late nov/early december -> irl stress + feeling like I had no future again due to prevalence of generative AI content and just generally having lost direction.
