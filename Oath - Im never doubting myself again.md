It's so weird, self-doubt really makes you irrational
I think I've been on the right path looking back. In retrospect, I can't really recall regretting any decisions that I've made so far. More like the self-hate I've been constantly experience is about the future.

I don't regret spending so much time learning art. I don't regret making the content I made. I don't regret redirecting my time towards making other content.
What got me really depressed was worrying that I won't get anywhere or won't have a future because it felt like I wasn't improving and I guess it was also because of twitter numbers.

Twitter numbers -
I have zero regrets that I've lost all the audience I had back when I was doing NSFW stuff more consistently. 
I had doubts and was miserable with the fact that my numbers now are low and the likelihood that my works will be seen by people is abysmally low.

However, when I look back and really dissect it, I don't think I've made any wrong decisions since I started doing art back in 2021

- 2021 - 
	- Made in Abyss, General Anime Fanart + Kpop fanart
	- First ever paid commission -> boxing art
	- Income: commissions -> I think it was really good. It wasn't much but I was so happy.
- 2022
	- My very first consistent client -> nsfw boxing art
	- Somewhat livable income from commissions. It was so painful but in the end I think it was all worth it. I improved so much and developed my drawing process.
	- Income: commissions -> I think this was the most that I earned and could have even been so much more had I not been in a relationship with someone.
- 2023
	- Joined /DAD/ -> learned sooo much about anatomy
	- Income: zero income -> 
- 2024
	- Returned to twitter, did a few nsfw boxing commissions for a bit, then finally called it quits.
	- Started doing some vtuber fan art. Particularly neuro. Then pippa. Then phase in general.
	- Started defining my art style.
	- Income: boxing comm then a tiny bit from fanbox -> It was a massive struggle to make money during this time. I switched to making nsfw loli content which was really hard to do commissions with. I couldn't use paypal for transactions like before and I couldn't find a platform to accept commissions with.
- 2025
	- Obliterated by getting banned from twitter.
	- Ended 5 yr+ relationship with gf. This plus losing my twitter account which I saw as my only means of income ended up really fucking me up mentally. 
	- Started getting into FlyFF and made art of FlyFF Characters -> gave me chitose
	- Started using unifans and finally got a bit of a start from it thanks to kai for commissioning an artwork.
	- Late nov/early december -> irl stress + feeling like I had no future again due to prevalence of generative AI content and just generally having lost direction. 
	- Started getting into music and made music-related art 
	- Started making covers using chitose
	- Income: zero then commissions (unifans) 

The future:
- I think a lot of my misery and self doubt is rooted in financial worries for the future.
- I think if I'm able to make stable income from art or music, I'd be okay.
- The plan:
	- I think it's to build stuff that I can earn consistently from:
		- Unifans commissions - I had a lot of gripes with this and I wanted to quit entirely, but I think it's okay if I do it sparingly, as long as my whole livelihood doesn't entirely depend on it, I'll be fine since that would allow me to accept commissions on my own terms. 
		- chitose2e - I think there's potential here. And I think I have what it takes to make it work. I love the stuff that I make, like I listen to the covers I make and actually enjoy listening to it. 
			- Regarding income from music:
				- I don't really know if the YT channel will earn ad rev by itself, if it does that'd be nice.
				- However, I think there's potential when it comes to doing production work.
					- I think there are people who need help with music production. aspiring vtubers who want to make their song covers etc.
				- Still though, I think just the fact that there's potential for my YT to start generating revenue already makes it worth it for me to actually keep pursuing. Just one video going viral could unlock stable means of income if I do it right. 
		- 21glucose / shirt prints / merch - I used to think this is going to be the way, but I'd be shelving this idea at the moment. I'll prolly dabble with it here and there because it's fun to design stuff.
