It's so weird, self-doubt really makes you irrational
I think I've been on the right path looking back. In retrospect, I can't really recall regretting any decisions that I've made so far. More like the self-hate I've been constantly experience is about the future.

I don't regret spending so much time learning art. I don't regret making the content I made. I don't regret redirecting my time towards making other content.
What got me really depressed was worrying that I won't get anywhere or won't have a future because it felt like I wasn't improving and I guess it was also because of twitter numbers.

Twitter numbers -
I have zero regrets that I've lost all the audience I had back when I was doing NSFW stuff more consistently. 
I had doubts and was miserable with the fact that my numbers now are low and the likelihood that my works will be seen by people is abysmally low.

However, when I look back and really dissect it, I don't think I've made any wrong decisions since I started doing art back in 2021
