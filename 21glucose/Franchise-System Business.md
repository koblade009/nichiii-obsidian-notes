Takeaways:
- Real business is built on systems not people.
- I'm stressed out with my art commissions because I handle everything: Customer Service (Spending time with clients), Manufacturing (Drawing), Marketing (Being active on twitter), Business Planning etc. This is the reason why my art commissions always fail because I burn out after just doing a few.
- Hustle/grind is not a good business strategy because your business dies the moment you get sick, get flooded/ravaged by typhoon or anything happens at all that prevents you from putting in work. Building a system that lets your business run like clockwork is the way to go.
- Systems = Repeatable process that guarantees the same result every.single.time.
- Think: How can someone do this without me?
