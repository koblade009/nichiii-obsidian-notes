Takeaways:
- Real business is built on systems not people.
- I'm stressed out with my art commissions because I handle everything: Customer Service (Spending time with clients), Manufacturing (Drawing), Marketing (Being active on twitter), Business Planning etc. This is the reason why my art commissions always fail because I burn out after just doing a few.
- Hustle/grind is not a good business strategy because your business dies the moment you get sick, get flooded/ravaged by typhoon or anything happens at all that prevents you from putting in work. Building a system that lets your business run like clockwork is the way to go.
- Systems = Repeatable process that guarantees the same result every.single.time.
- Think: How can someone do this without me?


The caveat tho is that this relies on labor from other people, which is something I couldn't afford just yet. 

Therefore I think the workaround for this would be to simplify/eliminate as much steps as possible from the process.

Currently:
1. Client dms me if im open for commission
2. I reply and ask what they'd like drawn
3. Client gives me info
4. I take it, tell them I'll make the sketch
5. Make sketch
6. Send to client, see if they approve of it
7. If not, either revise or just drop it entirely
8. If yes, proceed with refining
9. Send wips
10. Deliver
11. Wait till they approve it manually so that I can get paid
12. I get paid, I thank the client

Ideally:
1. Client sends me info, and how much they're willing to pay for it
2. I approve it or decline it
3. If approve, I draw the t
