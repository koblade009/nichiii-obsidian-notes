## What is Chitose Music Project?
I had this idea of turning [[Chitose Shinoda Williams|Chitose]] into a virtual performer. Motivation for this is that there are some music that I really love that don't really get much covers by vtubers due to the genre not fitting well with weeb culture. Refer to [[21glucose]] value proposition.

Right now, I really want to make a cover of some local bisrock songs just to get it started. [[Interests of Nichiii]]

## Advantages:
- Advertisement for [[21glucose]] [[Clothing Prints via Fourthwall]] and other products.
- YT audience is new audience.
- Another way to express myself instead of just drawing.
- **Benefits from accumulation. The more stuff I make, the better.**
- **Once made, can provide income indefinitely**


## Asset wishlists:
- 3D model for chitose
- FL Studio
- Kasane Teto or custom UTAU voicebank

## Additional Notes:
- Don't wanna make things too high effort. The idea right now is to just use static art as the backdrop for the video. Maybe even add some translated lyrics to it. But the main draw is to just hear an anime girl cover some songs that I love.
- This one was waaaay harder than I initially expected. I realize I encounter the same issues that I do in art, in that the recording sounds really good once I used to it, but then the day after, I find that I'm actually singing out of tune.
	- I have a couple of solutions for this:
		- Learn how to sing better, (Really hard, people literally train their whole lives for this) I am severely out of practice, I've been skipping vocal warmups and practicing scales 
		- Use customized UTAU/FLStudio for vocals (Also has a learning curve to it, also might needs knowledge of some music theory)
		- Outsource singing to someone else (Costs money and takes time to find someone who's willing to do it)
	- I might just be overthinking it though again cuz I didn't want it to be high effort, but at the same time, part of me feels ashamed of releasing something that's just bad.

## Ideas:
- KDB - Small World
- Ambassadors - Daw Sama sa Iro
- Mantequilla - Ibog-ibog
- Radiohead - Let Down
- Omar Baliw x CLR - R.O.T. OR K&B IV
## Protocol (Recorded vocals convert)
 1. Curate song
 2. Creation of backdrop image > Clip Studio Paint > 1-2 days
 3. Record / Acquire vocals > Audacity > however long < This is very important
 4. Acquire instrumentals > Audacity < 1-2 days < Ideally, I won't have to record
 5. Convert vocals to Chitose voice > W-okada
 6. Combine & Mix Audio > Audacity (Ideally, FL Studio would be used here)
 7. Video Editing > Davinci Resolve
 8. Schedule publish on YT (Credit all assets used, songwriters and instrumentals especially)
 9. Only after scheduling: For translation of non-english tracks, mayhaps edit the YT CC?

- Input: Audio, and drawing
- Output: Youtube Video
