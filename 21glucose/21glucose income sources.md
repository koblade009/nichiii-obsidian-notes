## [[21glucose Marketing]]

## Key points to consider before pursuing income sources:
- Scalability
- Ease
- Results/Products/Fulfillment can be replicated reliably
- Comes with as few bloat as possible [[De-bloating v1]]

## Currently considering:
-  [[Clothing Prints]]
-  [[Chitose2e]] - Music project 

## Not yet:
- Merchandising for [[Personal Projects of Nichiii]]:
	- Reasoning: No audience for it yet
- [[Season of Obsession]] Fan Merch/Not just clothing prints (Needs to be studied best way to approach this)
	- Reasoning: I'm not even really sure if I wanna do this.

## Low chance but still considering:
- Manufacturing of vtuber/content creator assets < - Will only be scalable if the assets are meant for generic use
- Digital Products - doujinshis, sticker packs, wallpaper <- These require me to put a shitton of hours to make these, so it's likely not feasible atm
- Game Development <- I'm particularly interested with this because it involves a lot of creativity
- YouTube <- Mayhaps? Dunno tho. It is very scalable though.

## Absolute no-go:
 - Streaming
