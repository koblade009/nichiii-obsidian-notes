## Key points to consider before pursuing income sources:
- Results/Products/Fulfillment can be replicated reliably
- Already has a successful example of it that can be copied, iterate/differentiate from it later.

## Currently considering:
- [[Clothing Prints]]
- YouTube content creation
- [[Fan Merch]] - for gacha games


## Not yet:
- Merchandising for [[Personal Projects of Nichiii]]:
	- Reasoning: No audience for it yet

## Low chance but considering:
- 3D animation

## Absolute no-go:
 - Streaming
