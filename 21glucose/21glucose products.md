## Key points to consider before pursuing income sources:
- Results/Products/Fulfillment can be replicated reliably
- Already has a successful example of it that can be copied, iterate/differentiate from it later.

## Currently considering:
- [[Clothing Prints via Fourthwall]] - This is more like a long-term/accumulating thing. 
- [[ChitoseYK]] - It's a personal project but at the same it's also a product/asset of the company

## Not yet:
- Merchandising for [[Personal Projects of Nichiii]]:
	- Reasoning: No audience for it yet

## Low chance but considering:
- 3D animation for YouTube
- [[Fan Merch]] - for gacha games

## Absolute no-go:
 - Streaming
