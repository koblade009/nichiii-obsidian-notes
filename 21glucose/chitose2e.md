## What is Chitose Music Project?
I had this idea of turning [[Chitose Shinoda Williams|Chitose]] into a virtual performer/an avatar for me to do music covers. Motivation for this is that there are some music that I really love that don't really get much covers by vtubers due to the genre not fitting well with weeb culture. Refer to [[21glucose]] value proposition.

Right now, I really want to make a cover of some local bisrock songs just to get it started. [[Interests of Nichiii]]

## Simplifying things:
- Guitar and vocals only
- I think it's important to grind out the guitar and vocals first and hopefully improve at it before adding more complexity to it
- Just a simple drawing as the video backdrop
- No 3D music, or lyrics on screen. 
- As barebones as possible. I want it to feel like just hanging out with friends and jamming out.
- Just focus on improving on guitar and vocals bit by bit.

## Advantages:
- Advertisement for [[21glucose]] [[21glucose Clothing]] and other products.
- YT audience is new audience.
- Another way to express myself instead of just drawing.
- **Benefits from accumulation. The more stuff I make, the better.**
- **Once made, can provide income indefinitely**
- Great synerygy with [[21glucose Clothing]]


## Additional Notes:
- This one was waaaay harder than I initially expected. I realize I encounter the same issues that I do in art, in that the recording sounds really good once I used to it, but then the day after, I find that I'm actually singing out of tune.
	- I have a couple of solutions for this:
		- Learn how to sing better, (Really hard, people literally train their whole lives for this) I am severely out of practice, I've been skipping vocal warmups and practicing scales 
		- Use customized UTAU/FLStudio for vocals (Also has a learning curve to it, also might needs knowledge of some music theory)
		- Outsource singing to someone else (Costs money and takes time to find someone who's willing to do it)
	- I might just be overthinking it though again cuz I didn't want it to be high effort, but at the same time, part of me feels ashamed of releasing something that's just bad.

## Content aside from music: (Might need a dedicated note for this)
- Powerpoint presentation ala Dota2Powerpoint - Maybe for Nikke? Or Gacha? I think instead of going for the gameplay/meta perspective, I could prolly go for the character history angle. 
	- Say, powerpoint presentation about Cammelya's backstory on Wuwa etc.
	- Eitherway I love his content and style. https://www.youtube.com/@Dota2PowerPoints
- Cuz I kinda wanna expand a bit some more from just bisrock music. I don't think there's an active community for it. It was the same when I made art for FlyFF, there wasn't really a community around it. < - On this note tho, I think the fault is partly on myself as well. Cuz if you look around on twitter, there are communities who literally exist solely because one artist is hella dedicated on making content for it. Like Houseki no Kuni and even Orb. On this note, I think I'll need to give it more thought. [[Community to Serve]]

## Protocol (Recorded vocals convert)
 1. Curate song
 2. Creation of backdrop image > Clip Studio Paint > 1-2 days
 3. [[Vocal recording]] / Acquire vocals > Audacity > however long < This is very important
 4. Record guitar > I think it's important for me to keep instrumentals acoustic, so that I won't get my channel copyright struck
 5. Convert vocals to Chitose voice > W-okada
 6. Combine & Mix Audio > Audacity (Ideally, FL Studio would be used here)
 7. Video Editing > Davinci Resolve
 8. Schedule publish on YT (Credit all assets used, songwriters and instrumentals especially)
 9. Only after scheduling: For translation of non-english tracks, mayhaps edit the YT CC?

- Input: Audio, and drawing
- Output: Youtube Video
