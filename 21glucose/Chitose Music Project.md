## What is Chitose Music Project?
I had this idea of turning [[Chitose Shinoda Williams]] into a virtual performer. Motivation for this is that there are some music that I really love that don't really get much covers by vtubers due to the genre not fitting well with weeb culture. Refer to [[21glucose]] value proposition.

Right now, I really want to make a cover of some local bisrock songs just to get it started. [[Interests of Nichiii]]

## Advantages:
- Advertisement for [[21glucose]] [[Clothing Prints]] and other products.
- YT audience is new audience.
- Even though it's unlikely for this to generate much income (if at all) by itself, I think it's still really nice to just be able to post something and then get money from it forever 


## Additional info:
Don't wanna make things too high effort. The idea right now is to just use static art as the backdrop for the video. Maybe even add some translated lyrics to it. 
But the main draw is to just hear an anime girl cover some songs.

## Asset wishlists:
- 3D model for chitose
- FL Studio
- Kasane Teto or custom UTAU voicebank
