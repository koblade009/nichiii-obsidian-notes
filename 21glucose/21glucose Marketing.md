## Marketing methods I guess:
- Not really sure rn tbh. 
- Marketing is kinda just like funneling I think
- For now what comes to mind is:
	- pixiv -> twitter -> 21glucose
	- discord fanart channels -> twitter -> 21glucose
	- existing space/community that wants to buy stuff -> twitter -> 21glucose
	- youtube -> 21glucose
- The ideal setup would be if there's no need to build an audience cuz the community of buyers already exists



## Nikke skeb marketing:
- Funnel:
	- Blablalink -> Twitter -> 21glucose Nikke Fan Merch
	- Pixiv -> Twitter -> 21glucose Nikke Fan Merch
	- Nikke Discord -> Twitter -> 21glucose Nikke Fan Merch
	- /nikg/ -> Twitter -> 21glucose Nikke Fan Merch


## Reflection
- I think it's difficult to have an idea how to market it if I'm not even sure what the target market is, or if there even is a market for it.
- Based on some vids I've seen, it's pretty much a folly to try to build a market for something that doesn't already have a market
