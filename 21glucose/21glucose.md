### What is 21glucose?
21glucose is a new thing I wanna start. It's a company pretty much.

### How does 21glucose operate?
ATM 21glucose only operates thru the efforts of 1 person. [[nichiii]]

### What's the vision for 21glucose?
I want to build 21glucose into a business that can operate without my supervision. Or at least with less work on my part. I want it to be able to generate money for me even in times that I am unable to work.

### How does 21glucose make money?
ATM it generates no money at all.
The things I'm considering can be found at [[21glucose income sources]]

### What's the game plan to promote 21glucose into a thriving, self-sustaining machine?
Tbh, I have no fucking clue. 
Right now, I'm pretty much trying out whatever hustle seems interesting for me. I do know one thing tho. It's that it has to involve sales/selling stuff. 
Game plan right now is just:
- Make product
- Promote brand and product
- Generate as much visibility as possible to my twitter account via fan art and maybe collaborating with other artists/businesses if given the chance.

## Value proposition/Problems 21glucose aim to solve

Right now, I think there is a gap for weebs like myself who are struggling with balancing living in the real world and living in the culture/internet. I, for example, struggle with living out the weeb lifestyle irl because of my environment and financial limitations. 

Not only that, I also struggle to fit in both in the real world and in online communities. I think the issue stems from the fact that I am too much of a degenerate for the real world and I have too many irl obligations to fully commit myself to the online life. 

Another is regional limitations, I am a weeb in Cebu who also likes the stuff that I see here in Cebu which does not really fit exactly well with weeb culture entirely. 

With this in mind, I think there are some things that I could probably put effort in that would provide value to people who have the same struggles that I have:

- Create merchandise that represents weeb stuff but are still going to be presentable irl.
- Create merchandise that is extremely affordable. At the same time, they look really good. Merchandise that you will not feel ashamed of wearing in real life.
- Create products/merch that bridge non-weeb hobbies to weeb culture. 
- Create products/merch that represent Cebu culture. Ones that represent well but also will fit in naturally wherever you are. 

Therefore, the core offerings would be:
- Cheap / Affordable products
- High quality designs
- Products/Merchandise that express love for the culture
- Products that express love for non-weeb hobbies but expressed in weeb ways
- Products that you will not be ashamed to wear in the real world

## Core Value of 21glucose as a brand: Love
Mainly influenced by [[Core Values of Nichiii]] #2
Therefore there are rules that I to abide by when designing products:
- Never make a product for something that you don't love.
- Never make a product that promotes division/hate. Don't participate in culture war.
