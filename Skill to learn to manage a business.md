# Takeaways
- Don't focus too much on technical mastery because advancements in technology will eventually lessen its value. 
	- Example: Digital art, around early 2000s the skill ceiling was not quite as high, due to Photoshop being the only real program artists can use. Then clip studio paint arrived and with it came 3d models to trace over. Suddenly people started using it and now, perfect perspective is the norm. Then digital art courses became more prominent, pushing the standard for rendering (for hired work) even higher. And now, AI image gens are becoming more and more accessible and better. Artists are now integrating stable diffusion into their workflow, so now, perfect perspective, perfect rendering, and now visual appeal is the standard. 
	- I struggle to catch up tbh. It's like I try to do things my way, no reliance on 3d, hand-drawing things and trying to make things appealing, but in the end I couldn't keep up. I guess an analogy with it is fighting people armed with guns using a spear. Yeah, my weapon is perfectly functional but if I try to compete, I get obliterated. I try to avoid using tools like 3d as much as possible because I feel like the more digitalized my process is, the less I enjoy it. Add in that I'm not even that technically skilled at all. And it's a recipe for doom.
