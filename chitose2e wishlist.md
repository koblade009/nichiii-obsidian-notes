I wanna move beyond doing acoustic covers since I've sorta gotten the hang of adding digital drums now. 

I still have a lot of gripes with the converted vocals, it just doesn't really capture my singing properly and it sounds really dead/janky a lot of times. I think I'll need to start looking to using something like Synthesizer V, like vocaloid stuff since from what I've seen it's makes clean vocals and you have a lot more control with it.

Anyways, wishlist:
- Synth V / free alternatives
- Strings VSTs
- Synthesizer VSTs
- Guitar Amp VSTs
- Piano/Organ VSTs 
- More digital sounding synths <- I think something like Flip D (exbatallion) kinds of sounds,  something like PinocchioP sounds as well. Something modern sounding.
	- I think there's value in doing a modernized cover of an old song that I love
		- Say, imagine bisrock stuff but it has instrumentations that are more akin to vocaloid music
	- Biggest inspiration for wanting a more digital sound as well is because I've been listening a lot to chicosci lately and they've been doing really cool digital sounds to their music which I feel adds soooo much to their songs. Ex. raspberry girl and last look

Getting these would also involve having to learn how to use them...

But essentially I wanna improve the sound of my covers. And then hopefully once I get good enough, I'll be able to write my own tracks/songs. I think I have a lot of use cases for owning my own music. Ex. drawing stream bgm, music for any animations I might make, and also just expressing my self in the most accurate way possible, being able to say what I wanna say about the world.

Gear wishlist: (nice to have but I can still make stuff without them)
- Electric Guitar
- Acoustic Guitar
- Better Mic
- MIDI controller
