## Why:
- Super important to keep my life balanced
- Bloat doesn't just consume time, it also consumes brainspace / causes stress.
- Something that I've noticed while trying to build apps is that the less bloat there is, the better. I think this also applies to customer experience in businesses. I think businesses should just be bloat-free in general.


## Identifying bloat:
1. If something doesn't affect me positively in anyway, it's bloat
	- Examples:
		- Culture war
		- Politics
		- Streamer/Content Creator Beef/Controversy
2. If it's something that requires way too much effort for too little benefit or self-fulfillment, it's bloat
	- Examples:
		- Maintaining certain gacha game dailies
3. If I do something for the express purpose of making money and it's neither: growing nor making money, it's probably bloat.
