Super important to keep my life balanced

1. If something doesn't affect me positively in anyway, it's bloat
	- Examples:
		- Culture war
		- Politics
		- Streamer/Content Creator Beef/Controversy
2. If it's something that requires way too much effort for too little benefit or self-fulfillment, it's bloat
	- Examples:
		- Maintaining certain gacha game dailies
3. If I do something for the express purpose of making money and it's neither: growing nor making money, it's probably bloat.
