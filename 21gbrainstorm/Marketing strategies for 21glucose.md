## Key considerations:
- Marketing strat should not cause burn out
- Should be something that can be automated / integrated to other processes / or people do it for you
- Existing successful business should exist to copy


## Reflection
- I think it's difficult to have an idea how to market it if I'm not even sure what the target market is, or if there even is a market for it.
- Based on some vids I've seen, it's pretty much a folly to try to build a market for something that doesn't already have a market
