I think this is important so that I don't entirely lose my marbles. 
This doesn't violate [[Core Values of Nichiii]] #1

# Proposed changes:
## [[NSFW Commissions]]
- I think I'll need to pull the plug on this.
- When I think about it, I don't think [[21glucose]] benefits much from taking NSFW commissions. 
- NSFW artworks CAN drive traffic to it. But making NSFW art doesn't mean I have to do NSFW commissions.

## [[SFW Commissions]]
- I'll have to scale this back. Instead of taking any commissions. I should make it more specific.
- Idea:
	- NIKKE Skeb via Unifans
		- In this manner, I am already completely familiar on who I'm drawing. 
- And that's it. No commercial comm. No anything. Much less stress.
- Although... I wouldn't really mind drawing NSFW for NIKKE tbh

Therefore eventually, [[Businesses of Nichiii]] is just going to be:
- [[21glucose]]
- NIKKE Skeb via Unifans

I'd be losing out on sales for sure. I prolly won't even get ANY commissions. But I think it's better to put myself at risk for a potential future where I'm happy compared to a certain future of me being constantly miserable.
