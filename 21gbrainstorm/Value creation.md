## Value creation:
- There's a process in value creation: TLDR, Identify the problem, Sell the solution
	- Identify problem
	- Educate people of said problem 
	- Market and offer your solution to them. Communicate to people that they need your solution and your solution is the best.
- Value creation is rooted in human needs:

	- If a problem you've identified is here, then you can definitely make some money selling the solution.
	- Once you've identified which need your business addresses, you gotta make that need the center of your marketing. Gotta hammer it.

## My own thoughts:
- I think the lowest that I can go on the needs chart is probably Safety Needs: Resources (For business). Like business to business type deal. Therefore I should prolly think of good, highly profitable b2b businesses.
