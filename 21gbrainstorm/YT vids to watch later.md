## Value creation:
- There's a process in value creation: TLDR, Identify the problem, Sell the solution
	- Identify problem
	- Educate people of said problem 
	- Market and offer your solution to them. Communicate to people that they need your solution and your solution is the best.
- Value creation is rooted in human needs:

	- If a problem you've identified is here, then you can definitely make some money selling the solution.

## Copying businesses
This one has something I feel I needed to hear:
- "I like copying businesses that already work and then iterate/differentiate myself later"
- Originality is mostly just ego/pride, therefore it should not be allowed to get in the way of starting a business
- Marketing and business models -> Just copy what successful businesses do. Chances are, if their marketing strategies work for them, it'll prolly also work for you
