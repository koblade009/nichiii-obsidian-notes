##  Reflections:
1. Something that I've noticed while trying to build apps is that the less bloat there is, the better.
2. A good business is something that feels like playing to you but looks like work to others.
	- Extremely poignant. Drawing to me feels like work but looks like play to others.
	- A person who enjoys walking will walk further than the person who wants the destination.
		- On point as well. When I draw, I don't draw for the process, I draw because the art is just a means to an end to me. I don't enjoy the process of drawing, it doesn't relax me.
		- I love drawing, but I only love it if it's going to serve me in other ways later on. 
			- ex. "This is going to make my media tab look nice later"
			- "This is a good way to get some visibility on the Nikke community"
			- "This is going to be a nice way to express my love for this music artist"
	- I might be on the wrong path tbh. 
	- Stuff that I enjoy the process of:
		- Writing/Journalling
		- Curation
		- Organizing (Not events, just making things organized)
		- I still enjoy making things, but then again, I only enjoy it if it's going to serve me in other ways later on.
