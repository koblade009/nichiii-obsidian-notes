SOME NOTES:
- MIKAH at this point still doesn't have the ASURA, She only has DASH and LEAP at this point

CHAPTER OBJECTIVES:
- Very briefly show that GRAVES and BLOOD are travelling to LAZULIA
- Showcase how abusive the guards really are to the citizens of PINAS. One citizen ran to the guard to ask for help because her husband is being beaten by drunkards. The guards ignored her plea for help and instead molests her and tell her that she's not a true citizen of the LAZULIA because of her descent
- Showcase Jojo's style fight scene
- Showcase how much of a hard-ass CARLOS is
- Showcase how much CARLOS loves her daughter ANNE and their bond. This scene reminds MIKAH of her father and she is visibly in emotional pain, knowing what she has to do next.
- Showcase the ugliness and underhandedness of how MIKAH fights
- Showcase how broken MIKAH is by the end of the fight
- Showcase ANNE witnessing the fight between MIKAH and CARLOS
- Showcase the ugliness of PINAS, how everyone there is starving and it's a dog eat dog world
- Showcase how paranoid NOAH really is since he gave MIKAH an absolute order of killing him if he refuses to see him
- Showcase MIKAH having a horrified look as she noticed ANNE's face seething with hatred right after she killed CARLOS
- Showcase MIKAH being distraught afterwards
- Pose the question of "Can such a black and tainted person like me ever be redeemed? Is there even hope to this life"

PLOT BEATS:
- CARLOS calls out MIKAH about her being essentially the same as him. Trapped in a life of crime, not loving the job that they do.
- MIKAH is visibly affected, lashing out at what he said but pushes those feelings down those feelings anyway.

BLOOD: It is. Now, hide your hat for a bit so that we can infiltrate it.
GRAVES: Okay!~
