Beings that are gifted with [[Seal]]s after undergoing a process called [[Awakening]] and can be further increased via [[Second Awakening]].
[[Mage]]s are able to channel their [[Mana]] through the palms of their hands and soles of their feet. This is the reason why [[Seal]]s manifest on their limbs.

Creatures eligible of becoming [[Mage]]s:
[[Human]]
[[Demihuman]]
[[Intelligent Monster]]s
