[[Golden Troupe]]
# Info:
Driving motivation: Pride, Vengeance

Leader of [[Golden Troupe]]
Cousin of [[Bonnie Davidsen Merriweather]]
Close friend of [[Zullie Frankenstein Von Koenigsegg]] (She rescued him from a life of slavery)
His closest friends were permanently killed during his rescue.
Their names are: Mamon, Soysoy, Pogi, Marktabz, Dabidi, Atan

Even though he's the leader, the only person he can reliably command is [[Chitose Shinoda Williams]]. [[Zullie Frankenstein Von Koenigsegg]] tends to disobey him due to her wanting to avoid work as much as possible. And [[Bonnie Davidsen Merriweather]] also tends to disobey him cuz she's a bit spoiled, not only that, he tends to give her special treatment willingly anyways.
