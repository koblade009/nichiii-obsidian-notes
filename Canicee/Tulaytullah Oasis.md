Need to travel through [[Great Desert of Tulaytullah]] to access this region

This oasis moves around because the source of life underneath, the [[Great Living Water]] constantly moves around. Because of this movement, this area is extremely hard to find and pin down. This region moves at around 1 meter per day.

Has the unique, hidden city of [[Biringan]]
