District of [[Lazulia]]
Has the [[Freedom from Wolves Lending Company]]

Mostly populated by humans of [[Desertfolk]] descent

[[Desertfolk]] wanted to migrate to the [[Lazulia]] but were barred from residing within its walls and was thus forced to live outside. As a result they were looked down upon and had to live in slums.

As a result of this, most inhabitants of this district suffer from poverty and violence is at an all time high.

Additionally, [[Desertfolk]]s are constantly under abuse by the [[Blue Kingdom's Military Police]]
