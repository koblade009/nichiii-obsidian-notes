Relationships:
[[Mikah's Father]]:
She loves her father and feels indebted to him. When she was young, she used to resent him for allowing her to be born into this world. But over time, as she grew older she saw just how much her father is sacrificing and working just for her sake. Her father died, decrepit, old. Gone were the days when he had muscle and used to be strong.


History:
Young age:
- Used to be a happy child
- Mother and Father split, mother left to live with a drug lord, later on was found dead, strangled and naked
- Father took on the role of raising her. Ending up excessively working. As a result she is left alone in the house, no one left to protect her.
- Estranged relative suddenly comes home bringing a "friend" who will "guard" her in the house. Actually sold her to someone to be raped.

Mikah's story arc is someone who lives an empty life of killing to survive and wants to break free from it. Make an honest living with her skillset, and see the colors of what life really has to offer. I think I should prolly highlight that the business of killing is a miserable one for her. She is overworked, underpaid and it kills her soul every single day that she does it, and the only reason she got into it was because of her dire life circumstances that forced her into it in the first place. Another thing to point out is that Mikah has no one in her life. She has absolutely zero social skills, especially when doing mundane things. And also, killing is a massive struggle for her. She gets beat up, stabbed, and her fights are ugly and a struggle every single time. She is not a trained assassin, she only manages to stay alive because she's extremely persistent. Her kills are not heroic or awesome. Instead, they're hard to watch and pathetic. Not to mention, most of the people she's hired to kill have their own formidable bodyguards who outclasses her entirely. They have better spells, better bodies, better genetics, and better training.

As a result of this, she closes down on everyone. It's not until when she was in her breaking point, alone in her room, sobbing, her last cat dying of old age, that she opens up as a result. As she was contemplating ending her life, she meets a young girl (graves), accompanied by someone (witch of smoldering blood) that she tells someone of her struggle (might as well tell someone before I die). This leads to her being told valuable words that changed how she sees the world. She's also offered to some fight trainings by (blood, this is important because blood is an assassin type) over the next couple of days. Because of this interactions, she gained an idea of how beneficial it is to talk to someone, as even if its a very small chance that they would connect, its lifechanging when its the case. She's especially extremely fond of graves and reminds her of her little sister (as welk as who she used to be) and blood is like a mother to her (she never grew up with a mother).

Also note that graves talked to her and coaxed her to open up because graves can sense souls, and she can feel how immensely sad Mikah is. Anyways, the witches have to leave at some point. And life returns to normal for Mikah. She cherished those few days more than anything thats come before in her life. But alas, tragedy struck. Something horrible has happened that made her snap and become fully resolved to leave the life shes currently living now. (edited)

Thus begins the story of how she got hunted down by her employer, and how she struggles for life and earn her freedom once and fo all.

I guess the ending of her dedicated story part is her reuniting with graves and blood once again. She's an entirely changed person. And she's strong enough now to be able to fight monsters. She would then find her place in the world travelling with a ragtag team consisting of two witches and other rejects of society. She is happy, "softer", "kinder", and goes out of her way to help people even at the expense of going through hardship. Do note that her outlook towards everyone before this point was very hateful. Because shes been done wrong by the world and she projects that hate to everyone and she thinks no one understands. But graves was able to see through that, and challenged her outlook, pretty much destroyed it on their first meeting. She came to realize that the things shes been doing the world are exactly the things that she experienced from the world. She destroys everyone elses life because to her, everyone destroyed her life. Now she knows that it's a vicious cycle and pretty much the only way to break free from it is to do something good first. Out of kindness, expecting nothing in return. Because when you do so, you break the cycle of hatred that's someone else is in. Of course, this idea gets challenged a lot from that point on. After all, no good deed goes unpunished.

Mikahs adversary, foil to her character. Someone who sees the world where taking advantage of people's goodness is necessary. That because the world has no obligation to reward anyone for doing kind things, that it's our obligation as humans to protect what we have. I honestly dont know, I had a good idea but forgot. Essentially hes someone who sees doing the right thing, or kind thing is extremely difficult. And has been broken by it. Someone who used to do extremely kind things but evetually got worn down to dust because people took advantage of him. He lost everything due to how the world devours those who opens themselves up to helping people, doing the right thing. Now his mentality is shifted in that the right thing is to protect what you have from the wolves of society by not being vulnerable. And instead taking life by the reins and doing what is necessary to have a chance at life. He also went through the same hardship as mikah as he also grew up in the slums of pinas. He is extremely physically weak making him a prime target to be taken advantage on. Without power he could not protect those that are precious to him and so he sees it as a necessity to get power and fight back and fend off the wolves. Because it's those wolves that keeps destroying his home, his safe space. It's those wolves that make doing the right thing hard because those wolves take advantage of people doing the right thing.


Something that I wanna include is the reason why she went to travel with graves and blood in the first place. Well, she's always cooped up in her room. And the reason for that is because the air outaide feels suffovating (not literally) but theres this constant sense that she isnt welcome there and that she doesnt belong. However due to plot reasons or something, she was forced to travel alone and she felt good about going out for the first time, being away from the city, actually feels light on her as if a weighy has been lifted. Due to this, she chose to travel with the witches, she noticed that when shes with them she doesnt feel soffuvated.
