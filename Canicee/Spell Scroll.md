[[Spell Scroll]]s are items used by [[Mage]]s to acquire new [[Spell]]s.

[[Spell Scroll]]s work by making the [[Mage]] who is using it recite an incantation which activates a [[Conditional Spell]] which burns the seal into the [[Mage]]'s memory thereby implanting it permanently. The [[Spell Scroll]] then disintegrates due to having its latent [[Mana]] completely depleted.

[[Spell Scroll]]s are created by [[Spellsmith]]s
