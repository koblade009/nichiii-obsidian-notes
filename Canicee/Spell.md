[[Spell School]]s

[[Spell]]s are learned by looking at the [[Spell Diagram]] of a [[Spell Scroll]] while chanting its inscription. When it is done, the paper crumbles and the [[Spell]] is learned.
Only [[Mage]]s can learn [[Spell]]s and they can only learn the [[Spell Tier]] that are equivalent to the number of [[Seal]]s that they have.
