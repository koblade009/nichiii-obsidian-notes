# Relationships:
- [[Bonnie Davidsen Merriweather]] - She is her best friend. They met through their old guild [[Bloody Cross]]. Chitose is really bad at forming relationships with others. This is due to her mostly seeing her interactions with people as purely transactional. However, due to being partnered with Bonnie at Bloody Cross, they went through 100+ missions together. Faced hardships together and eventually came to understand one another more than anyone else. Bonnie understands her struggles with interacting with people and gives her encouragement. On the other hand, Chitose also understand Bonnie's complex at being looked down by other people.

- [[John Merriweather Goldman]] - She obeys him, no questions asked, as long as it is paid work. Her nickname for him is "Bossman".
