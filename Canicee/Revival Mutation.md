Body mutation that occurs upon revival via [[Lodelight]]
These mutations are a result of an imperfect restoration of a destroyed body part.
Healing spells cannot restore these mutations due to the fact that the body treats these mutations as the normal state.

Characters known to have suffered [[Revival Mutation]]:
- [[Chitose Shinoda Williams]] - Left eye missing upon revival
- [[Zullie Frankenstein Von Koenigsegg]] - One lung was missing plus heart complications upon revival
