Used in casting [[Spell]]
Manifestation of [[Mana]]

Markings found on the limbs of [[Mage]]s. [[Seal]]s are acquired only after the process of [[Awakening]]. Awakened [[Mage]]s can acquire more [[Seal]]s through the process of [[Second Awakening]].
[[Seal]]s are also present in [[Catalyst]]s: [[Living Catalyst]] & [[Standard Catalyst]].

[[Mage]]s are able to channel their [[Mana]] through the palms of their hands and soles of their feet. This is the reason why [[Seal]]s manifest on their limbs.

[[Seal Count]] is the number of [[Seal]]s present, which dictates the amount of casts of a certain [[Spell]] within a certain [[Spell Tier]] a [[Mage]] can do.
