Abilities:
- She has no offensive witchcraft abilities, she wields a spear instead of a staff for this reason
- She can sense souls of living beings
- She can resonate with souls of living beings, making them feel more at ease with her (Only works if said beings don't see her as a threat) . More importantly, she can feel how a person is feeling by doing this.
- She's really good at chucking the pointy end of her hat towards an enemy


History:
Anyways right now, I'm thinking of making the witch of the graves' story a story about regrets. She hit a reset button and restarted her own lifecycle, forgeting everything shes done. But the consequences of her actions in the previous life remain. You can think of it as her hating herself so much that she wanted to have a chance to a new beginning. I want the new witch of the graves to be someone like phos. Someone who is essentially a blank slate but gets changed along the way. She is changed by the people she meets or the circumstances she face. Kinda like the ship of theseus.

All Dragon Kings are slave to the old Witch of the Graves (This is because she can easily wipe out their race in a blink of an eye. She has control of all souls all over the world.) They literally cant harm her cuz the moment their souls indicate any intent to harm her, they get killed on the spot. Because of this, the Dragon Kings made all their descendants to think of her as a benevolent God. So that no ill will goes towards her and no more draconic soul gets extinguished. All Dragon Kings who knew about this fact died out eventually. Time could not quell their resentment. And so they were extinguished. The only Dragkn Kings that remain are those who knew nothing of the whole ordeal and those who believe on the Witch as a benevolent being. Thus all the descendants of dragon kings like the dragon, wyvern, drake, and serpents are subservient to the new Witch of the Graves.
