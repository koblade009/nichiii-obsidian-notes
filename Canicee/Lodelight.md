[[Golden Troupe]]

Lodelight are structures scattered around meant to resurrect fallen humans. These structures were created by an ancient civilization and now the technology to maintain these structures have faded resulting in [[Revival Mutation]]

Human settlements tend to develop around [[Lodelight]]s and townsfolk heavily guard these for the benefit of [[Resurrection]]

Several [[Lodelight]]s have already been completely destroyed. War, deliberate human sabotage, disasters, monster attacks, and general wear has contributed to this.
