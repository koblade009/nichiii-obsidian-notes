[[Golden Troupe]]

[[Lodelight]]s are structures scattered around in [[Madrigal]]. These structures were created by an ancient civilization to [[Resurrection|resurrect]] fallen humans. The means to maintain these structures have been lost resulting in [[Resurrection |imperfect resurrection]] which causes [[Revival Mutation]]

Human settlements tend to develop around these structures and townsfolk heavily guard these for the benefit of [[Resurrection]]

Several [[Lodelight]]s have already been completely destroyed. War, deliberate human sabotage, disasters, monster attacks, and general wear has contributed to this.
