Wanna do:
- Writing antagonists, maybe for golden troupe or for witchlands.
	- I find it hard to make a character that I'm supposed to hate. I think I'm too attached to the things I make. I think if I'm able to detach myself better, it will prolly help me look at my works more objectively. Be it quality of art or music. I think it will also help me take critiques without stinging as much.
- Github 2FA setup before 20th December
- Dedicated illustration for chitose2e - chitose with an acoustic guitar
- Make fourthwall prints
- Learn how to sing properly <- [[My voice is also an instrument]]
	- After that I can post moar covers
- Prioritization:
	- For covers I think I need to prioritize the singing. I think as long as the singing is good, then it prolly shouldn't really matter if I don't make the instrumentation as complex as I want it to be. 
	- That being said I still really, REALLY, want to incorporate these to my covers tho:
		- Groovy bassline
		- Lead guitar stuff
		- Groovy rhythm guitar
		- + Relaxed / Groovy singing
	- I think I want to prioritize groovy-ness over complexity if possible. I mean the point of the covers after all is to make it feel like an acoustic guitar jam session with friends.
	- As long as I'm able to bob my head while listening to it. I think it's golden.
