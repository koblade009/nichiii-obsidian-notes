Wanna do:
- Writing antagonists, maybe for golden troupe or for witchlands.
	- I find it hard to make a character that I'm supposed to hate. I think I'm too attached to the things I make. I think if I'm able to detach myself better, it will prolly help me look at my works more objectively. Be it quality of art or music. I think it will also help me take critiques without stinging as much.
